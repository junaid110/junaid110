# 👋 Hi, I'm Junaid Abbas  

🚀 **Aspiring Data Engineer | Python | SQL | Data Pipelines | Cloud Learner**  

I’m an aspiring **Data Engineer** passionate about turning raw data into valuable insights.  
Currently, I’m building my foundation in **data acquisition, cleaning, transformation, and automation** while exploring cloud-based data solutions.  

I’ve learned and practiced **Python, Pandas, NumPy, BeautifulSoup**, and I’m currently working on **SQL Server** in my Data Engineering journey.  
Through hands-on projects like **Netflix Data Analysis** and **ETL with Python**, I’ve gained experience in real-world data manipulation, transformation, and loading techniques.  

💡 My long-term goal is to become a **Cloud Data Engineer**, designing scalable and automated data pipelines using tools like **AWS, Snowflake, Databricks**, and **Apache Airflow**.  

🌱 I believe in continuous learning, sharing knowledge, and contributing to the data community.
